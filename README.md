## 🕐 Why My Contribution Graph Looked Empty

Although I've been coding consistently for 8+ years, most of my work lived in **private repos** until recently. I'm now migrating projects to public GitHub to make my journey visible to recruiters and collaborators.

## 🎯 Career Goals

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience, now focused on building long-term value in a team that appreciates quality, clean code, and problem-solving. I'm looking for **remote or on-site full-time roles** where I can contribute meaningfully and grow with the product.

Over the years, I’ve worked across startups, businesses, and my own ventures — and now I'm looking to bring that experience into a stable, growth-oriented environment. I care deeply about building things that matter, and I’m ready for the next chapter.
